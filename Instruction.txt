Instructions:

-To generate public key and private key, use the function
	generateKeys()

-The public key and private key will be saved to txt files: 
	'my_elgamal_public_key.txt' and 'my_elgamal_private_key.txt’.

-I included my encrypted message file as 
	'elgamal_message_encrypted.txt'

-To decrypt my message, use the function
	elgamalDecrypt('elgamal_message_encrypted.txt', 'my_elgamal_private_key.txt')


-To encrypt message using my public key, use the function
	elgamalEncrypt('message.txt', 'my_elgamal_public_key.txt')

-I also included my original message file as
	‘message.txt’

I used codes from the course website. I didn’t collaborate with anyone.
